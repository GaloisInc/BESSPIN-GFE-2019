They were originally from MIT, for SMIPS tests.
These versions: modified at Bluespec, for RISC-V tests

In each directory, 'make' should cross-compile the C program using the
riscv-gcc compiler to create a RISC-V ELF file.

Please refer to the RISC-V Training slides in the Docs directory for details.

To build tests for RV32:
make 
make install

To build tests for RV64:
make XLEN=64
make install XLEN=64

If you are building tests for both RV32 and RV64, please complete both steps for
one setting of XLEN before proceeding to the next

To clean all RV32 binaries from the individual test directories
make clean

To clean all RV32 binaries including does installed
make full_clean

To clean all RV64 binaries from the individual test directories
make clean RV_XLEN=64

To clean all RV64 binaries including does installed
make full_clean XLEN=64

# Creating a new test
---------------------
An empty test with the boilerplate in place to create a self checking test is in
the TestTemplate directory. 

1. cp -r TestTemplate <your-test-name>
2. mv <your-test-name>/TestTemplate.c <your-test-name>/<your-test-name>.c
3. Edit <your-test-name>/<your-test-name>.c
4. Add <your-test-name> to the SUBDIRS list in the Makefile
5. Run make and make install with the appropriate command line options
