The two scripts in this directory,
   make_spi_mcs.tcl
   program_spi.tcl
respectively convert a .bit file into a pair of .mcs files, and load those
files into the dual flash memory units on the VCU118.  They should be invoked
by a line such as
   vivado -mode batch -source <script file>
"make_spi_mcs.tcl" assumes the bitfile is named fpga.bit in the current
directory.

After the flash memory has been loaded in this way, and assuming that the
switches on the board are correctly set(*), power cycling the board should
program the FPGA with the contents.  The FPGA may also be booted from the
flash memory by giving the "Boot from Configuration Memory Device" command
from Vivado's hardware manager.

Note that the bitfile must have been generated with constraints specifying its
destination.  The following constraints should be incorporated into the
design's .xdc file(s).
   set_property CONFIG_MODE SPIx8 [current_design]
   set_property BITSTREAM.CONFIG.SPI_BUSWIDTH 8 [current_design]
   set_property BITSTREAM.GENERAL.COMPRESS TRUE [current_design]
These properties seem not to affect Vivado's ability to load the FPGA directly
through jtag.  Compression is necessary because otherwise the bitfile will not
fit into the conversion program.

(A further script, for reading back the contents into a file, for verification
of the transfer, is under construction.)


(*) See the User Guide: set SW16 to 0001, position1->position4; it's probably
in this position already.
